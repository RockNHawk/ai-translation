wine tourism opportunity
colliers international is pleased to present ironwood estate to the market for sale .
located on the picturesque tourist trail between porongurup and albany , ironwood estate is an established winery and cellar door business . producing up to 1,500 cases of premium wine annually , and with a popular cellar door and caf é on site , ironwood estate provides an enviable lifestyle opportunity with a viable business . ( ironwood wines are sold on - line , at a variety of clubs and restaurants and through a range of bottle shops including dan murphy ’ s ).
ironwood estate comprises a land area of 45 hectares , with a combination of vineyards , dams and natural bushland with the stunning backdrop of the porongurup range . a magnificent 5 bedroom home with sweeping views across to the stirling ranges is the centrepiece of this outstanding estate . furthermore , development plans have been established for a major cellar door and function centre facility , along with hillside chalet development . interested parties can view these plans and get a feel for the enormous potential for this property into the future .
the overall property has been meticulously managed and maintained by the proprietors who established ironwood in 1996 .
the property has an abundance of water with a massive spring fed dam ( stocked with trout and marron ) , and a range of sheds and warehouses to assist in the operation of the property and business .
an additional 11 hectares adjacent to this property , but under the same ownership , has approval for an 11 lot subdivision which will come into the marketplace later in 2018 . this is not a part of the estate . other land in the near vicinity has been subdivided into lifestyle lots and these have sold steadily .
porongurup is a small but delightful town , but within easy reach of albany and mount barker , providing access to schools , hospitals and other amenities .
ironwood estate will suit an investor / business owner who is seeking to combine a sensational lifestyle with a manageable business . a new owner may choose to expand the winemaking capacity and / or unlock the additional tourism potential for the property , or take it as it is and enjoy all that this region has to offer .
